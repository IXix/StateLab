To keep things simple, we initially look for a machine called "Target".
Because PVST renames the machine on restore, we just keep using the same pointer after a target is found.

There are contect menu commands Store/Restore to save/load the target machine's state.
The same can be done from the pattern editor using 0 for store and 1 for restore on the track param.
The global param is unused for now.

x86 restore seems to work for native Buzz machines from both menu and pattern but PVST crashes from pattern.
Having said that, I haven't tested a native machine that saves very much non-param info yet.

x64 just doesn't work at all, the hack pointers aren't right
